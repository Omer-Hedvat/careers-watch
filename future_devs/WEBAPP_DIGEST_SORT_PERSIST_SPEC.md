## Overview

Sort is implicit, filters reset on every reload, and there's no result count.

## Behaviour

- Explicit sort controls: score desc (default), date scored desc, company A-Z.
- Persist filter + sort + min-score state in `localStorage` so returning users keep their view.
- Show "Showing X of Y" and a small per-tier count summary (e.g. 9-10, 7-8, 5-6).

## Files to Touch

- `webapp/frontend/app/digest/page.tsx` — sort control, localStorage persistence of filter/sort/min-score, result count + per-tier summary

## How to QA

1. Changing sort reorders the list (score desc, date scored desc, company A-Z).
2. Filters, sort, and min-score persist across reload.
3. "Showing X of Y" and the per-tier count summary are shown.
4. `uv run python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` passes.
5. `uv run python score.py --dry-run` passes.
