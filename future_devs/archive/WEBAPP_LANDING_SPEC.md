# Spec: webapp_landing

**Slug:** webapp_landing  
**Epic:** Web App v1  
**Effort:** S  
**Depends on:** webapp_scaffold ✅

---

## Goal

Build the public landing page at `/landing`. The root `/` redirects authenticated users to `/digest` and unauthenticated users to `/auth` (handled by `webapp_auth`); `/landing` is a standalone marketing page reachable from the auth page.

---

## Page: `webapp/frontend/app/landing/page.tsx`

Static server component (no `'use client'`).

### Sections (top to bottom)

## Styling constraints

- Tailwind only — no external UI library needed for this page
- Dark background (`bg-gray-950` or `bg-slate-900`) with light text
- Green accent for the primary CTA (`bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700`)
- The 3-step section: use a simple flex/grid layout with numbered circles
- Keep the component under 120 lines

---

## Touches

- `webapp/frontend/app/landing/page.tsx` (new)

## Exit gate

```bash
# File exists and has a default export
ls /Users/omerhedvat/git/careers-watch/webapp/frontend/app/landing/page.tsx
grep "export default" /Users/omerhedvat/git/careers-watch/webapp/frontend/app/landing/page.tsx

# Python pipeline unaffected
cd /Users/omerhedvat/git/careers-watch && uv run python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
uv run python score.py --dry-run
