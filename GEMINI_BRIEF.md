# Planning brief for Gemini

You are helping plan the next phase of **careers-watch**, a personal job-search
automation pipeline. This document orients you. Several raw repo files are
attached alongside it — read them, then help plan.

## Your job

Act as a planning collaborator. Propose the next phase of work: new features,
coverage expansion, quality improvements, or strategic direction. For each
proposal give: the problem it solves, rough effort (XS/S/M/L), dependencies,
and why it fits this candidate's actual goals. Rank by value-to-effort.

Do **not** write code. Output a plan.

## What the project is

Personal job-search automation for Omer Hedvat — Israeli senior data scientist
(~8 yrs), specialized in fintech-fraud and cloud-security ML, targeting Team
Lead / Lead DS / Applied ML roles in cyber and fraud companies, Israel-based,
max ~75 min commute (Netanya south through greater Tel Aviv).

Pipeline (three independently-runnable scripts, three cadences):

1. `refresh_companies.py` (weekly) — Playwright scrapes 22 VC portfolios +
   merges a manual `big_companies.yml`, auto-detects each company's ATS, caches
   to `companies.json` (~2000 companies).
2. `collect_jobs.py` (daily) — hits each ATS REST API directly (18 ATS
   integrations: Comeet, Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, Ashby, etc.), filters by
   location, writes `new_jobs.json`.
3. `score.py` (daily) — sends each job to Gemini 2.5 Flash, scores against
   `profile.md` + `cv.md`, writes a ranked `digest.md`.

There is also a multi-user web app layer (Next.js + FastAPI + Supabase, on
Render) that was built out in Phase P2 — see `WEBAPP_SPEC.md`.

## Current state (read the ROADMAP files for detail)

- P0 Pipeline, P1 pipeline improvements, P2 Web App v1, and most of P3
  (coverage expansion) are **wrapped**.
- Active/open: `SCORING_RUBRIC_ABLATION` (scoring calibration doc), a few
  webapp post-launch polish items, and the long tail of VC/ATS coverage.
- No active epics. The bug tracker is essentially empty.

So the interesting question is **what the next epic should be**, not finishing
an in-flight one.

## Hard constraints — do not propose anything that violates these

The project has deliberate scope discipline. These are intentionally OUT of
scope unless there's an overwhelming reason:

- No SQLite / database for the pipeline — `companies.json` + `new_jobs.json` +
  `digest.md` are the only persistent pipeline state.
- No email / Slack / Telegram delivery — Omer reads `digest.md` directly.
- No generic scraping framework or plugin system — per-VC and per-ATS adapters
  are the chosen design; don't refactor to a generic engine.
- No auto-apply, no per-job resume tailoring.
- LLM calls live ONLY in the scoring step (`matcher/`). Discovery and collection
  are deterministic by design — do not propose LLM-based careers-page discovery.
- Dependency tree is intentionally minimal (playwright, httpx, google-genai,
  python-dotenv). Adding a dependency needs justification.
- User-facing output uses hyphens, never em-dashes.

If a proposal would cross one of these lines, flag it explicitly and explain
the tradeoff rather than assuming it's fine.

## Good directions to consider (not exhaustive — push back and add your own)

- Scoring quality: calibration, rubric ablation, reducing false positives/
  negatives, spot-check tooling, measuring score stability.
- Coverage: more Israeli VCs / ATSes, dedup quality, dead-company pruning.
- Signal: trend analysis over time (which companies hire, score drift), the
  analysis notebook direction.
- Web app: turning the personal pipeline into a real multi-user product, or
  deciding to keep it personal.
- Reliability: failure recovery, stale-entry handling, observability of the
  weekly/daily runs.

## Attached files and why

- `CLAUDE.md` — architecture, conventions, gotchas, full scope discipline.
  This is the most important file.
- `profile.md`, `cv.md` — the candidate's filter intent and capability ground
  truth. Any feature about matching quality must respect these.
- `ROADMAP.md`, `ROADMAP_ARCHIVE.md` — what's planned vs. already shipped, so
  you don't re-propose finished work.
- `README.md` — external summary, architecture diagram, scale numbers.
- `WEBAPP_SPEC.md` — the web app product layer.
