# BUG: Positions detail panel shows "Go to posting" twice (button + redundant inline link)

## Status
🔵 Open

## Severity
P3

## Description
The Positions page in-app detail view (`PositionDetailPanel` in
`webapp/frontend/app/(app)/positions/page.tsx`) renders the same "Go to posting"
call-to-action twice:

1. As the primary action button in the panel's `actions` row (the intended CTA).
2. As an inline text link inside the "Job description" fallback copy
   ("Open the posting via *Go to posting*.").

Both link to the same `apply_url`. The inline link is redundant and reads as a
duplicate. Keep the button; drop the inline link from the description fallback
(reword the sentence so it no longer repeats the CTA).

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the webapp, go to the Positions page.
2. Click any open position row to open the slide-over detail panel.
3. Observe the "Go to posting →" button near the top (actions row).
4. Scroll to the "Job description" section.
5. Expected: one "Go to posting" CTA. Actual: a second inline "Go to posting"
   link appears in the description fallback text.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** —
- **Blocks:** —
- **Touches:** `webapp/frontend/app/(app)/positions/page.tsx`
- **Spec files to update:** — (behavior unchanged; no spec owns this copy)

## Fix Notes
<!-- populated after fix -->
Remove the inline `<a>Go to posting</a>` at lines ~84-88 of `positions/page.tsx`
and reword the fallback sentence (e.g. "The full description isn't stored in the
shared catalog - use the Go to posting button above to open the original
posting."). The `actions`-row button is the single CTA.
