"""
SAP SuccessFactors public-careers puller.

SuccessFactors is a multi-tenant enterprise platform whose tenants expose three
quite different public surfaces. This puller targets the most common branded
"jobs2web" front-end (e.g. https://jobs.sap.com/search/) because it serves
plain HTML with server-side location filtering — the cleanest of the three.

Reconnaissance notes (run on 2026-05-17):

- SAP's branded host (https://jobs.sap.com/search/?locationsearch=israel) returns
  6 Israel-based postings as static HTML in <tr class="data-row"> rows. Job
  detail pages embed the description inside <span class="jobdescription">. This
  surface is fully scrapable with httpx, no JS rendering required.

- CyberArk was acquired by Palo Alto Networks. https://www.cyberark.com/careers/
  now embeds Palo Alto's Workday board (paloaltonetworks.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com),
  and the residual https://www.cyberark.com/careers/all-job-openings/job-post/
  template links out to https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Cyberark1— CyberArk
  is on SmartRecruiters, not SuccessFactors anymore. So no SuccessFactors
  fetcher will ever return CyberArk jobs; that's a SmartRecruiters puller.

- The other two SuccessFactors surfaces (the JS SPA at career.successfactors.eu
  and the OData /odata/v2/JobRequisition feed) are not used here. The SPA needs
  Playwright; the OData feed needs tenant API credentials. Both are blocked for
  the SAP tenant. Add support only when a real big_companies.yml entry needs it.
